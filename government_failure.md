# Government failure - When public sector intervention leads to inefficiency

Caused by:
* Lack of incentives. Public sector workers less likely to be paid for performance / profit targets.
* Levels of bureaucracy. Governments tend to have more layers of administration and planning.
* Political interference. Decisions made for short-term political gain - rather than sound economics, e.g. keep on unproductive workers.
* No consistency. Change of government often leads to change of approach and new political initiatives.
* Moral hazard - Government can act lender of last resort - this may encourage banks to take risks knowing they will be bailed out.
* Regulatory capture - When government agencies become too friendly with business/groups they are trying to regulate.
* Unintended consequences. Policies to reduce relative poverty 'means-tested benefits' can create 'welfare dependency.
